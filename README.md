Machine Learning Methods Course Repository

Welcome to the Machine Learning Methods Course Repository! This repository is designed to provide comprehensive resources for mastering fundamental machine learning techniques such as Regression, Classification, Clustering, and Regularization.

# What's Included:

## Regression Techniques 
Dive into the world of predictive modeling with regression algorithms. Explore linear regression, polynomial regression, logistic regression, and other regression variants to predict continuous outcomes and understand the relationship between variables.

## Classification Methods 
Learn how to classify data into distinct categories using various classification algorithms such as decision trees, support vector machines (SVM), k-nearest neighbors (KNN), and ensemble methods like random forests and gradient boosting.

## Clustering Algorithms 
Discover unsupervised learning techniques for identifying patterns and grouping similar data points together. Explore clustering algorithms including k-means, hierarchical clustering, and density-based clustering methods like DBSCAN.

## Regularization Techniques 
Understand the importance of regularization in machine learning models to prevent overfitting and improve generalization. Learn about L1 and L2 regularization, elastic net regularization, and how to tune regularization parameters for optimal performance.
