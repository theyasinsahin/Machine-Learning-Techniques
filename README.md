# Machine Learning Methods Course Repository

Welcome to the Machine Learning Methods Course Repository! This repository is designed to provide comprehensive resources for mastering fundamental machine learning techniques such as Regression, Classification, Clustering, and Regularization.

## What's Included

### Regression Techniques 
What is the difference between supervised and unsupervised learning? What is regression and, more specifically, linear regression? How can we use linear regression to predict a numerical value?

Regression models use an algorithm to understand the relationship between a dependent variable (input) and an independent variable (output). One of the most well-known and understood regression algorithms is linear regression.

### Classification Methods 
What if we are not interested in predicting a number but a category? How can we use machine learning to predict classes and categories instead of numerical values?

Classification is the process of categorizing a given set of data into classes. The pre-defined classes act as our labels, or ground truth.

The model uses the features of an object to predict its labels. E.g., filtering spam from non-spam emails or classifying types of fruits based on their color, weight and size.

We will use the logistic regression algorithm to demonstrate how to solve classification problems. We will also cover one more machine learning algorithm – Support Vector Machines (SVM).


### Clustering Algorithms 
How can machines learn something from a dataset if it doesn’t have any labels? What is an example of an unsupervised learning algorithm? How can data be classified into specific groups?

Unsupervised learning is used to discover hidden patterns in the data without human supervision. It is an effective tool for data analysis to find similarities and contrasts.

For example, grouping customers according to the types of products they look up & the amount of time they spend online, to analyze which group spends more.

We will learn about clustering problems which involve the grouping of data points. To solve these problems, we will use the K-means clustering technique.

### Regularization Techniques 
How well does a model generalize to new data and how can we improve it? What do we mean by overfitting and underfitting, as well as variance and bias?

Regularization can be used to regulate a model to prevent it from underfitting and overfitting and to reduce high bias and variance. In this module, we will talk about two types of regularization: lasso and ridge regularization.
